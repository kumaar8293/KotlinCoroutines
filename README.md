## Kotlin Coroutines Tutorials/Programs
### About this project:
* If you want to get started with Kotlin Coroutines, then may be this project is for you. Learn Kotlin Coroutines, its basics and Fundamentals from scratch. 
## Key Points :

### 1.What are Coroutines?
   - Light-weight Threads but **`Coroutines != Thread.`**
   - Like Thread Coroutines can run in parallel/Concurrent, wait for each other, and communicate with each other.
   - Coroutines are very, very cheap - almost free, Creates thousands of them without any memory issue.
   - It is best for modern application.

### 2. How are they related to Threads?
   - In case of Thread, Application will wait to finish until all the threads finish.
   - Un-like threads, for coroutines the application by default doesn't wait for it to finish its execution.(Means, application will not wait for coroutines to finish, it will finish the program automatically).

### 3. Coroutines Builders?
   - Coroutines Builder are used to create Coroutines.

### 4. Types of Coroutines Builders?

#### A. launch [Fire and Forget]
   - Launches a new Coroutine **_without blocking the current thread_**.
   - Inherits the thread and coroutine scope of immediate parent coroutine.
   - Return the reference of **Job object**.
   - Using Job object you can cancel or wait for the coroutine to finish. 
#### B. async
   - Launches a new Coroutine without blocking the current thread.
   - Inherits the thread and coroutine scope of immediate parent coroutine.
   - Return the reference of **`Deferred<T>`** object, Which is subclass of Job object.
   - Using DeferredObject you can cancel or wait for the coroutine to finish.
   - We can use that return value `[val deferredValue = deferredJob.await()]`
   - In case to wait => If you don't want to use the return type then use **join()** else **await()**
#### C. runBlocking
- **runBlocking()** is generally used to write test cases to test the suspending functions.
- launch and async are non-blocking in nature but runBlocking() **blocks the thread**.
#### D. withContext
- It is used to switch Context.
- It's a suspending function, and it's cancellable by default.

### 3. Cancel Coroutine
#### Why Would you cancel a Coroutine?
- A: Result no longer needed.
- B: Coroutine taking too long to respond. etc.

#### How to cancel a Coroutine?
- To cancel a Coroutine, it should be cooperative.
- **job.cancel()** => If the coroutine is cooperative then cancel it.
- **job.join()** => Wait for the coroutine to finish.
- **job.cancelAndJoin()** => If the coroutine is cooperative then cancel it else Wait for the coroutine to finish.
#### What is cooperative? and how to make Coroutine cooperative?
- Only those suspending functions that belongs to kotlinx.coroutines package will make coroutine cooperative.
- **`delay(), yield(), withContext(), withTimeOut()`** etc. are the suspending functions that belongs to **`kotlinx.coroutines`** package.
- There is another way to make coroutine cooperative => Explicitly check for cancellation status within the coroutine **`[CoroutineScope.isActive]`**

#### Handling Cancellation Exceptions?
- Cancellable suspending functions such as yield(), delay() etc. throw **CancellationException** on the coroutine cancellation.
- **NOTE :** We can't run suspending function from Finally block, because the coroutine running this code is already cancelled.
-  If we want to execute a suspending function from a finally block then wrap the code  within the **`withContext(NonCancellable)`** function
- launch, async, runBlocking, withContext, withTimeoutOrNull,



- Timeouts
- Exception Handling in Coroutines
- Sequential execution of suspending function in Coroutines
- Concurrency within Coroutine
- lazy 'async'
- CoroutineScope and CoroutineContext
- Dispacthers: Confined dispatcher, Default Dispatcher, and Unconfined Displatcher
